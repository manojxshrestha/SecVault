SecVault is a comprehensive collection of security testing resources designed for penetration testers, ethical hackers, and security researchers. The repository contains various types of wordlists, payloads, and dorks related to common web vulnerabilities such as Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.

The main goal of SecVault is to provide a centralized repository for security researchers to easily access the tools, payloads, and resources needed for security assessments. By leveraging these resources, testers can enhance their penetration testing efforts and identify vulnerabilities more efficiently.

## Repository Overview

SecVault is organized into several categories based on the type of vulnerability or security issue being tested. Some of the primary categories include:

- **LFI/RFI (Local/Remote File Inclusion)**: Includes payloads and parameters for testing file inclusion vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Command Injection**: A collection of payloads designed for testing command injection vulnerabilities.
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Various payloads for testing SQL Injection vulnerabilities, including blind SQLi, error-based SQLi, and more.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Payloads and dorks to help detect and exploit XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Resources to help identify and exploit remote code execution vulnerabilities.
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**: Payloads to test SSRF vulnerabilities that occur when the server is tricked into making requests to internal or external resources.

In addition to these core categories, SecVault includes resources for web enumeration, password cracking, web fuzzing, and even bypassing security mechanisms in CMSs like WordPress.
